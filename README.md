# Lucas N. Aveiro

A learner on a journey to become a full-stack web developer. 
I thrive in environments where I can focus deeply on crafting and efficient solutions. 
I enjoy the intricacies of both front-end and back-end development and am committed to continuous growth and improvement in this ever-evolving field.
